# Ex. No: 18E - Count the Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph

## AIM:
To write a Python program to **count the number of triangles** present in an **undirected graph** using matrix operations.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Initialize a matrix `aux2` to store the square of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph²`).  
Also, initialize a matrix `aux3` to store the cube of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph³`).

**Step 2**: Multiply the adjacency matrix with itself to compute `aux2 = graph × graph`.

**Step 3**: Multiply `aux2` with the adjacency matrix again to compute `aux3 = aux2 × graph`.

**Step 4**: Compute the **trace** of the matrix `aux3` (i.e., the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix).

**Step 5**: Divide the trace by **6** to get the number of triangles in the graph.  
*(Each triangle is counted six times in the trace — twice per vertex and once per direction.)*

**Step 6**: Return the result.

import heapq

graph = {
    1: [(2, 1), (3, 4)],
    2: [(3, 2), (4, 5)],
    3: [(4, 1)],
    4: []
}

def dijkstra(start):
    pq = [(0, start)]
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    dist[start] = 0

    while pq:
        d, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] > d + weight:
                dist[neighbor] = d + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor], neighbor))

    return dist

print("Shortest paths:", dijkstra(1))

```

## OUTPUT
```
Shortest paths: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4}

```

## RESULT

Shortest path from source to all vertices is calculated successfully.
